% This Pie Chart uses the ``pgf-pie'' package which is based on pgfplots
% and **not** hosted on CTAN but mirrored on Github (cause Google Code shutdown).
% Although people on StackExchage vote against using this package or even using
% Pie Chart, we used it here to get close look and feel as with the one produced
% by WYSIWYG WPS.

% This package is the first one installed manually by me. I learnt the TDS (TeX Dir Struct)
% from here and dropped .sty and pdf manual to the right places under $TEXMFHOME and run
% texhash and I could use it like ``\usepackage{pgf-pie}'' and view its doc by ``texdoc pgf-pie''.
