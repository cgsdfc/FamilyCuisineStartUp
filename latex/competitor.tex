% The package makecell offers a macro for making
% cells of multiple line in a tabular environment
% inside which \\ can be used.

% This is the first solution I tried, but later replaced it
% with more primary solution. See below.

% Instead of manually breaking lines, we use makecell
% to make each cell with long text line a paragraph.

% The reason I didn't use |p{}|p{}|p{}| is _only_ those
% cells with lone lines need to be in paragraphs and makecell
% allows to format each of those cells rather than selecting
% a whole column (|c|c|c| is called column specifier). 

% However, the m{} solution make the code look short.
% Using the array package, we can use p{} for paragraph towards the top
% m{} for paragraph towards the middle and b{} for paragraph towards the bottom.
% We can also use >{decl} and <{decl} to insert decl before and after column specifier.
% Here I want those paragraphs to be both horizental and vertical centered, so the m{}
% and >{\centering}.

% The width of the paragraph in each cell is 1/3 of the \textwidth since we have 3 columns
% in total.
% Note here: since we are using >{decl} construct in the last column, we should use \tabularnewline in place of
% \\ or LaTeX will say "Misplaced \noaligned"!
